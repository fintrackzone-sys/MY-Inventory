# Task: Fix Stock Barcode Button to Enable Barcode Scanning for Transactions

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Improved Quagga barcode scanner configuration with back camera preference and additional readers
- [x] Changed stock-barcode-btn behavior to open transaction modal with scanned item selected instead of auto-saving
- [x] Added console logging for successful scanner startup
- [x] Enhanced error handling and user feedback for barcode scanning

## Summary
The stock barcode button now properly enables barcode scanning and opens the transaction modal with the scanned item pre-selected for outgoing transactions, providing a better user experience for inventory management.
